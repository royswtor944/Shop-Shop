## Description
An e-commerce application that allows users to shop for various items, add these products to the shopping cart, manage the shopping cart by increasing and decreasing quantities, check out their purchases and see their order history.

User Story:

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform

I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API

SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state

WHEN I review the appâ€™s store

THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store

THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider

WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state

THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store

THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions

THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

## Languages/Applications:
